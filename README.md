Description
-This Sudoku Solver is a Python-based program that automatically solves any valid Sudoku puzzle using the **Backtracking Algorithm**. It efficiently finds the solution by filling in missing numbers while ensuring that each row, column, and 3×3 subgrid follows the Sudoku rules.  

This project is useful for:
- Sudoku enthusiasts who need a quick solution.
- Students learning about recursion and backtracking in Python.
- AI and algorithmic problem-solving practice.

Features
- Solves any valid 9×9 Sudoku puzzle.
- Uses Backtracking Algorithm for an efficient solution.
- Simple and clean Python implementation.
- Prints the solved Sudoku grid in a readable format.

Installation & Usage
Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
